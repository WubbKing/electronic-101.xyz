<p align="left">In this tutorial, we will learn how to drive an NEC LD8113 VFD
tube with simple 74-series logic.</p>
<p align="left">The key to this tutorial is to have it display numerals 0...9
with a centered 1.</p>
<p align="left">This logic is just like Gottlieb's logic as used on pinball
tables from Cleopatra SS (1977) to Ice Fever (1985).</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="LD8113.jpg" width="107" height="195"></p>
<p align="left">So we have our VFD tube... now what? We can't just run <i>everything</i>
off of 5V... the filament will burn out if we do that! And that voltage is also
too weak for the grid and anode plates.</p>
<p align="left">What we do is use a buck converter set between 1 and 2V for the
filament and a boost converter set about 18V for the grid and segments. This
gives a nice, bright display.</p>
<p align="left">Then for the logic, we use a 74LS48 with BCD paralleled to a
74LS04 and a 74LS21. We invert lines B, C, and D with three stages of the
74LS04, leave A noninverted, and feed them into a four-input AND from half the
74LS21. This output gives us both the extra segment for the 1 and an input for
another stage of the 74LS04, giving us an inverted output for the blanking input
of the 74LS48.</p>
<p align="left">But... where does 18V come in? We use a source driver, such as
the UDN6118A or the UDN2981A, to drive the segments at 18V from TTL logic
signals.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="LD8113Control.GIF" width="819" height="329"></p>
<p align="left">Follow this schematic and you should get a 0 on startup with all
BCD inputs grounded. With a BCD code of 0001 loaded, the 1 should center itself
on the extra segment in the display. All other numerals should appear as normal.</p>
<p align="left">For reference, see the GIF below...</p>

What the display should look like with the above logic setup.</p>
